## Cljs-Sweetalert

A minimal cljs-wrapper for [sweetalert](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert)

Still very much in Alpha, use at own risk.

Aiming to include sweetalert as CLJSJS dependency
## Try it out

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vikeri/cljs-sweetalert.git
cd cljs-sweetalert
lein cljsbuild once example
open example/index.html
```
